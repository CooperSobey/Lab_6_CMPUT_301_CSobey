# Lab_6_CMPUT_301_CSobey

NOTE: I tried resolving this with the TA's but even they couldn't figure it out and I couldn't find anything online to resolve it. My add function in CityList.java for some reason can't be accessed despite being public and my City file as a whole can only be accessed 50% of the time with no rhyme or reason for it. The app still runs no problems but it causes a ton of issues with my tests and debugging that I have no clue how to resolve.

The issue appeared first when I was just following along with the lab presentation. The TA even tried restarting the project too see if that would fix it to no avail.

Thank you for your understanding.
